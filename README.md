# EMG
The EMG database is collected form UCI-Machine Learning Repository 
The data were collected at a sampling rate of 500 Hz,
using as a programming kernel the National Instruments (NI) Labview.
The signals were band-pass filtered using a Butterworth Band Pass filter with low and high cutoff at 15Hz and 500Hz respectively and a notch filter at 50Hz to eliminate line interference artifacts.
The hardware that was used was an NI analog/digital conversion card NI USB- 009, mounted on a PC.
The signal was taken from two Differential EMG Sensors and the signals were transmitted to a 2-channel EMG system by Delsys Bagnoli√¢ Handheld EMG Systems.

The subjects were asked to perform repeatedly the following six movements, which can be considered as daily hand grasps:
a) Spherical: for holding spherical tools
b) Tip: for holding small tools
c) Palmar: for grasping with palm facing the object
d) Lateral: for holding thin, flat objects
e) Cylindrical: for holding cylindrical tools
f) Hook: for supporting a heavy load

5 healthy subjects (two males and three females) of the same age approximately (20 to 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 30 times each. 
The measured time is 6 sec. There is a mat file available for every subject.
